# OSI 7 layers Model #

OSI stands for “Open Systems Interconnection”. OSI model is a tool used by IT professionals to actually model or trace the actual flow of how data transfers in networks. So, basically, the OSI model is a logical model/representation of how the network systems are supposed to send data (or, communicate) to each other.
