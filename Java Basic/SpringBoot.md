# Spring Boot #

Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a Micro Service.

## Getting Start ##

### AutoConfiguration ###

Spring Boot Auto Configuration automatically configures your Spring application based on the JAR dependencies you added in the project.

Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project by using **@EnableAutoConfiguration** annotation.

*For example*, if MySQL database is on your classpath, but you have not configured any database connection, then Spring Boot auto-configures an in-memory database.

### Component Scan ###

Spring Boot application scans all the beans and package declarations when the application initializes. You need to add the **@ComponentScan** annotation for your class file to scan your components added in your project.

### Main Method ###

The main method should be writing the Spring Boot Application class. This class should be annotated with **@SpringBootApplication**. This is the entry point of the spring boot application to start. You can find the main class file under src/java/main directories with the default package.

```java
package com.helloworld.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
   }
}
```

### Dependency Injection ###

In Spring Boot, we can use Spring Framework to define our beans and their dependency injection. The **@ComponentScan** annotation is used to find beans and the corresponding injected with **@Autowired** annotation.

If you followed the Spring Boot typical layout, no need to specify any arguments for **@ComponentScan annotation**. All component class files are automatically registered with Spring Beans.

### Logging ###

Spring Boot uses Apache Commons logging for all internal logging. Spring Bootâ€™s default configurations provides a support for the use of Java Util Logging, Log4j2, and Logback. Using these, we can configure the console logging as well as file logging.
